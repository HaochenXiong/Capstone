        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <p>"Digital Heroin" or "Digital Future" is an interactive digital archive built in pure html, css, and javascript. It is a developing capstone project aimning at
            gamifying the creator's research as it is related to video games. The project specifically focuses on China but it also has been attempted in practices within global contexts.

        <h3>"Digital Heroin"</h3>
        <p>
        The video game has been a growing interactive medium since the invention of the computer, but not without its 
        <span class = "controversies" onclick='window.location.href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_controversies"'>controversies</span>. 
        Since <i>People's Daily</i>, the official newspaper of the Chinese Central Committee, 
        first called video games “digital cocaine” in 1984, video games have never shaken their negative connotations as e-drugs. 
        They are always perceived as a symbol that presents violence, salacity, and the fundamental origin of teenage rebellion. 
        </p>
        <h3>"Digital Future"</h3>
        <p>
        The Video game have long been recognized as the best port for an ultimate digital migration - the metaverse we now only see in novels and movies. 
        The opportunity it creates presents the potential desire of human beings to live anywhere, play anywho, and travel anytime. 
        Simulations have already been implemented in various dustries and a meta-simulation might eventually appear just like how we play a video game.
        </p>
        <h3>Creator's Statement</h3>
        <p>
        There has never been a better time to rethink our relationship to video games.
        Given the development of metaverse and the general digital migration, video games as a medium have become more important not only to generation Z but also to the whole world.
        However, the fact is that there is never a clear or complete gaming industry or gamer culture in China but only one supported by fragmental localities such as smuggled goods and we media. 
        Conflicts between the offcial voice and the local response have resulted in the continuously changing definition and development of video gaming, 
        forming different imaginations and understandings of its production, promotion, and perception.
        This project propose a stop to look back into the past and see what interconnections we have missed within different historical moments; 
        thus bringing us new perspectives on the radical changes currently taking place in this field.
